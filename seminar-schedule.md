Biomimetic Hydrogels for the Sustained Delivery of GLP-1 Analogues to Improve Treatment of Diabetes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The most challenging aspect of optimal glycemic control for the 118 million people in the US living with diabetes is impaired regulation of hepatic glucose production, which eventually leads to β-cell failure. Current insulin treatments are highly burdensome, resulting in poor patient compliance, and can cause dangerous hypoglycemic events. In contrast, treatment strategies based on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone secreted from the intestinal L-cells after ingestion of carbohydrates, reduce the risk of hypoglycemia by stimulating insulin and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. As GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in the body, various GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been developed and approved for clinical use. Similar to endogenous GLP-1, GLP-1 RAs lower endogenous glucose production without the risk of hypoglycemic events and, importantly, expand insulin-secreting β-cell mass and restore the native ability of patients to regulate glycemia. Unfortunately, current GLP-1 RAs must be injected either daily or weekly, which results in significant patient burden and reduced patient compliance. Missing even one injection has important longitudinal effects as it takes several injections to return to therapeutic serum concentrations. New formulation approaches are needed to prolong therapeutic GLP-1 RA delivery to maintain therapeutic concentrations over the course of months per administration. We have developed an injectable hydrogel depot technology leveraging supramolecular interactions between polymeric nanoparticles and hydrophobically-modified hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymers, that enable prolonged delivery of GLP-1 RAs. This hydrogel depot system sustains release of therapeutic protein cargo, enabling consistent diabetes management over the course of months with a single administration.</details>

Immune cell metabolism: A pivot in tissue engineering

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The metabolic underpinnings of immune cells in the implant microenvironment are poorly characterized, despite the critical role which foreign body response (FBR) plays in the function of implants. For instance, polylactide (PLA) is an old and the most widely used biopolymer in medicine. For decades, PLA had been thought to activate immune cells by reducing surrounding pH because PLA biodegrades into monomers and oligomers of lactic acid. This correlational observation had guided therapeutic strategies aimed at neutralizing pH in the PLA microenvironment. While undoubtedly offering some benefit, clinical reports of adverse immune responses to PLA persist to-date, significantly limiting the clinical utility of PLA. During my talk, I will present novel findings challenging this paradigm. Recent data shows that neutralized or acidic PLA degradation products activate immune cells. Uniquely, these activated immune cells exhibit previously unreported changes in metabolism. Specifically targeting altered metabolic pathways modulates inflammatory and fibrotic outcomes to PLA degradation. Interestingly, one of the small molecules used for targeting altered metabolic pathways is an acid, questioning the role of acidity in inflammatory responses to PLA and highlighting the pivotal role of immune cell metabolism in tissue engineering.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
I am an expert in biomaterials for drug delivery who has centered my research around opportunistic pathogens and commensal microbes. My graduate training focused on the development of an antibiotic delivery system for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement that improved upon several limitations of PMMA antibiotic bone cement. Specifically, it allowed for delivery of antibiotics previously not compatible with bone cement, was capable of more effectively treating long-term broad-spectrum infections, and could be refilled with additional drugs after implantation. As a postdoctoral researcher, I study how controlled manipulations to the composition of the gut microbiome influence bone tissue strength through clinical and pre-clinical studies. Through my work, I have found that the composition of the gut microbiome significantly differed in clinical orthopaedic surgery patients based on their pre-surgical bone mineral density. Additionally, my work has shown that gut microbiome-induced changes in bone matrix are not limited to the bone tissue that is formed while the microbiota is altered, suggesting that it may be possible to improve bone matrix later in life through microbiome-based interventions. As an independent investigator, my goal is to use my expertise in drug delivery platforms to develop systems that deliver molecules that mimic the function of beneficial gut microbes. The microbiome is a complex consortium of microbes that has been shown to be implicated in several disorders. Therefore, materials that mimic the function of therapeutic microbes have the potential to impact several distal organs. My long-term vision is to pioneer the next-generation of microbiome-based therapeutics that mimic the function of beneficial microbes, overcoming the challenges of delivering live microbes.</details>

Engineering meets biology: Three dimensional bioprinting of tissues and organs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
A lot of money is spent developing new pharmaceutical drugs, but approval rates are
declining and fatal diseases like influenza, COVID19 are left untreated. This is because
animal testing methods don’t accurately predict human response to drugs. What if we
can 3D print living human tissue to test new drugs and study disease? 3D printing of
lung tissue allows us to develop better, safer, and cheaper drugs while reducing our
reliance on animal testing. Beyond drug development, this could usher in a future where
replacement organs are 3D printed using patient’s own cells, avoiding organ waitlists
and risk of rejection.

Engineering Organoid Microsystems to Model Human Physiology and Disease

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Recent advancements in organoid technology and organs-on-chips, also known as microphysiological systems or tissue chips, have provided new approaches to study human development and model disease states. While organoids rely on the self-organizing properties of human pluripotent stem cells to recapitulate the complex three- dimensional cellular microarchitecture of complete organs, organs-on-chips aim to reverse engineer the minimal functional unit of human organs by combining microfluidics and human cell lines. The integration of organoids and organs-on-chips offers the opportunity to overcome the limitations of each technology and enable the development of advanced in vitro microsystems to model diseases and test novel therapies. However, this requires a multidisciplinary design methodology to combine the specific biological needs of three-dimensional organoids with the design constraints of microfluidic organ-on-chip platforms. My research focuses on designing and implementing organoid microsystems engineered to recapitulate human physiology and disease. Here, I discuss the application of computational fluid dynamics to develop a microfluidic culture platform for organoids and the use of single cell RNA sequencing to characterize CRISPR-engineered organoids.

Mechanical forces regulate collagen turnover in health and disease

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Aberrant structure and altered composition of extracellular matrix (ECM), a hallmark of fibrosis and other pathologies including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, aging, etc., produce altered physical properties that lead to impaired function of almost all tissues. Fibrosis, a cause of almost half of all deaths in the developed world, is a condition where post-injury wound healing response causes abnormal deposition of the most abundant protein collagen and other ECM proteins in most adult tissues. Currently, there are no approved therapies to fully resolve fibrosis. In general, fibrillar collagen levels scale with stiffness of tissues, i.e., soft tissues like developing heart, adult brain contain less collagen than stiff tissues such as tendon, skeletal muscle, etc. Mechanical load magnitudes sustained by stiff tissues are larger than softer ones. Collagen, primarily synthesized by tissue resident fibroblasts, undergoes post-translation modifications as intermolecular collagen crosslinks whereas matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) mediate degradation of collagen. Thus, a well-regulated collagen turnover, reflected as a balance between synthesis and degradation of collagen, is necessary for maintaining proper structure and composition of ECM as well as enabling it to sustain mechanical loads resulting from cellular contractility and/or exogenous loads. In contrast, dysregulated collagen turnover during pathologies such as fibrosis results from perturbed interplay between ECM and cells that leads to tissues with increased stiffness and impaired function. Here, we uniquely combine label-free imaging, label-free methods to characterize biochemical composition and novel mechano- bioreactor designs to study fibrillar collagen in embryonic chick and adult mice tissues. Our data demonstrates that enzymatic degradation of tissue collagen by collagenases is mechanical strain dependent and is influenced by the presence of collagen crosslinks. The strain-dependence of collagen degradation by collagenases is independent of factors such as cellular protein synthesis and activity/specificity of collagenases including MMPs on collagen. Thus, collagen turnover focused understanding of tissue mechano-homeostasis, warrants the use of ECM mechanical stimulation as a therapeutic strategy to tailor ECM-cell interplay for restoring function of fibrotic tissues and improving tissue regeneration, which may include applications such as biomedical devices, tissue engineering, biomechanics, etc.

Beating as One: Mitigating Arrhythmias and Improving Electrical Coupling in Engineered Heart Tissues

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Heart attack survivors live with permanent damage in their hearts and are at higher risk of developing heart failure. Current treatments do not directly repair or restore function in the damaged myocardium, motivating innovative tissue engineering solutions to remuscularize the heart. Implanting engineered heart tissues (EHTs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to restore contractility is a promising therapy. However, this approach is challenged by poor electrical integration between the epicardially implanted EHT and the host heart, as well as increased concerns for arrhythmogenesis. In this talk, we highlight our recent efforts in mitigating arrhythmias in large-scale EHTs and improving electrical coupling between EHTs to ensure safe clinical translation and delivery of this therapeutic implant. Briefly, we differentiated high-purity hiPSC-CMs (>85% cTnT+) to 1) construct self-compacting, large-scale EHTs (> 1x1 cm) in a collagen-1 mixture and 2) generate bioelectric sutures by seeding hiPSC-CMs onto fibrin threads. Optical mapping was performed to characterize the electrical properties of these engineered tissue constructs. We discovered that tissue geometries influence the arrhythmogenic state of EHTs by altering action potential duration heterogeneity and conduction, which we can leverage to reduce tissue susceptibility to developing arrhythmias. We also demonstrate that our bioelectric sutures were electromechanically active and enabled directed electrical propagation between two separate EHTs. Ongoing work focus on translating these findings in vivo in a rat model of myocardial infarction. Collectively, these preliminary results highlight a potential strategy for establishing electrical coupling between implanted EHTs and the host myocardium without inducing arrhythmias.

A de novo matrix for macroscopic living materials from bacteria

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
In medicine, there exists a ceaseless demand for new materials to support medical progress, specially designed to address complex diseases through multiple functions. Multifunctionality is a hallmark of living cells, and natural living materials such as bones and skins possess remarkable features that enable superior performance in complex environments; for example, the ability to dynamically respond to external stimuli, self-assemble, and self-repair in case of damage1. Moreover, the self-produced biopolymer matrix that embeds cells confers mechanical characteristics unmatched by any artificial material1. The ability to de novo engineer living materials would thus allow treating diseases with a unique combination of tailored mechanical properties and non-native biochemical functions. However, engineering cells to self-assemble into macroscopic materials with tailored mechanical and biochemical properties is beyond the current state of the art. In particular, we have lacked the tools and design rules to genetically encode a synthetic matrix that programs collective cell self-organization into macroscopic structures and allows us to tune the mechanical properties of the material. I created a macroscopic engineered living material (ELM) by genetically engineering Caulobacter crescentus to simultaneously display and secrete a synthetic matrix. This approach was successful in assembling cells into hierarchically-ordered centimeter-scale structures. Moreover, I showed that, through genetic modifications of the matrix, I was also able to control the stiffness of ELMs over a 16-fold range. This study provides design rules for the de novo engineering of ELMs. My future research will be aimed to refactor this system into lactic acid bacteria to create probiotic-based ELMs able to adhere to the gastrointestinal epithelium and deliver therapeutics. I envision that compared to standard engineered probiotics this approach will allow (i) to improve cell viability in the gut due to the presence of a surface-bound matrix, (ii) allow a local high-density of probiotic cells, and (iii) a better delivery of the probiotics to the specific site of active disease.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Autism is a socio-behavioral disorder, and diagnoses are conducted through behavioral screening instruments. Recent research suggests motor deficits may be a core symptom of the disorder, as children with autism present with deficits in motor development, locomotor skills, and postural instability. In addition, children with autism often have affected, executive function, attention, and perception cognitive domains. Different gait speeds have been used to examine gait adaptations in other clinical populations. Additionally, individuals with decreased cognitive abilities have demonstrated difficulties in modulating their walking speed. There is limited research on mechanisms children with autism use to alter their gait speed, or if cognitive abilities play a role in this task. Therefore, this multi-aim project sought to examine the mobility and cognitive mechanisms involved in altering gait speed in children with autism. Children with autism demonstrated different lower extremity angular joint positions in different speeds in the pre-swing sub-phase of gait, leading to increased hip extension, increased knee flexion, and decreased dorsiflexion at increased speeds. Large effect sizes observed in the ankle angular joint positions, suggest a primary kinematic strategy that involves the ankle when changing speed. Children with autism demonstrated no differences in dynamic stability when comparing different speeds, indicating dynamic stability is unaffected when altering gait speed. Children with autism presented with reduced cognitive abilities and slower cognitive processing. However, they did not differ from neurotypical children in their gait velocity or kinematics, indicating they mechanically alter their gait velocity, similarly to their neurotypical peers. Children with autism did not demonstrate correlations between cognitive processes and gait variables, which may indicate that children with autism are not using cognitive processes while changing their walking speed. The findings from this study may prove beneficial, as altering gait speed is a typical task children with autism use in their daily lives.

Directing the self-assembly of materials to treat cancer and autoimmunity

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Self-assembly allows for the design of complex and tunable biomaterials for drug delivery. During my PhD training, I developed bone-targeted polymeric nanoparticle (NPs) assembled through hydrophobic interactions between amphiphilic diblock copolymers to treat acute myeloid leukemia. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) binding NPs (TBP-NPs) were designed to target osteoclast deposited TRAP protein found in bone. Using a solvent-displacement method of drug loading, leukemia-relevant small molecule drugs were incorporated into the hydrophobic core of TBP-NPs and used to treat a preclinical leukemia mouse model. TBP-NPs reduced leukemic burden and improved survival while free drug treatments failed to exhibit comparable efficacy. In my postdoc, I am designing immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (iPEMs) built through electrostatic interactions to treat preclinical multiple sclerosis (MS) models through the co-delivery of myelin self-antigen and an immunomodulatory oligonucleotide. Thus far, we have shown that iPEMs downregulate inflammatory genes, increase regulatory T cell polarization, and improve disease outcome. Altogether, these studies highlight the versatility of self-assembled biomaterials to serve as tissue/cell-specific drug delivery systems and motivate further development of these systems to treat other types of diseases.

Genetic Variability Influences the Musculoskeletal Response to Disuse

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Mechanical unloading from disuse and spaceflight causes extensive bone and muscle loss. These effects increase the risk of musculoskeletal injuries. Genetic variability causes some people to inherently have greater bone and/or muscle mass, but we don’t know if genetic variability causes some people to be more protected from the catabolic effects of unloading. The Jackson Lab has recently developed a Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse by cross-breeding eight inbred founder strains for over thirty generations. DO mice have high genetic diversity and can be an excellent model for studying the role of genetic variability on health and disease. We took twenty sixteen-week old DO mice (ten female, ten male) and immobilized the right hindlimb for three weeks. Baseline and final day micro-CT scans were analyzed. We found there was significantly greater femur cortical bone area in the right leg at baseline, compared to the left leg. Genetic differences accounted for 93% of the variance in bone area. Three weeks of immobilization of the right leg caused significant decreases in cortical area and significant loss of muscle strength. Genetic differences accounted for 40% of the variance in response to unloading. These results suggest genetic variability can cause some people to be protected from the negative effects of unloading. Future work in my lab will investigate which genes are responsible as well as using DO mice to study the role of genetic variability in adaptation to exercise and nutritional interventions for musculoskeletal health.
