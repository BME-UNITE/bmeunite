Biomimetic Hydrogels for the Sustained Delivery of GLP-1 Analogues to Improve Treatment of Diabetes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The most challenging aspect of optimal glycemic control for the 118 million people in the US living with diabetes is impaired regulation of hepatic glucose production, which eventually leads to β-cell failure. Current insulin treatments are highly burdensome, resulting in poor patient compliance, and can cause dangerous hypoglycemic events. In contrast, treatment strategies based on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone secreted from the intestinal L-cells after ingestion of carbohydrates, reduce the risk of hypoglycemia by stimulating insulin and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. As GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in the body, various GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been developed and approved for clinical use. Similar to endogenous GLP-1, GLP-1 RAs lower endogenous glucose production without the risk of hypoglycemic events and, importantly, expand insulin-secreting β-cell mass and restore the native ability of patients to regulate glycemia. Unfortunately, current GLP-1 RAs must be injected either daily or weekly, which results in significant patient burden and reduced patient compliance. Missing even one injection has important longitudinal effects as it takes several injections to return to therapeutic serum concentrations. New formulation approaches are needed to prolong therapeutic GLP-1 RA delivery to maintain therapeutic concentrations over the course of months per administration. We have developed an injectable hydrogel depot technology leveraging supramolecular interactions between polymeric nanoparticles and hydrophobically-modified hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymers, that enable prolonged delivery of GLP-1 RAs. This hydrogel depot system sustains release of therapeutic protein cargo, enabling consistent diabetes management over the course of months with a single administration.</details>

Immune cell metabolism: A pivot in tissue engineering

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The metabolic underpinnings of immune cells in the implant microenvironment are poorly characterized, despite the critical role which foreign body response (FBR) plays in the function of implants. For instance, polylactide (PLA) is an old and the most widely used biopolymer in medicine. For decades, PLA had been thought to activate immune cells by reducing surrounding pH because PLA biodegrades into monomers and oligomers of lactic acid. This correlational observation had guided therapeutic strategies aimed at neutralizing pH in the PLA microenvironment. While undoubtedly offering some benefit, clinical reports of adverse immune responses to PLA persist to-date, significantly limiting the clinical utility of PLA. During my talk, I will present novel findings challenging this paradigm. Recent data shows that neutralized or acidic PLA degradation products activate immune cells. Uniquely, these activated immune cells exhibit previously unreported changes in metabolism. Specifically targeting altered metabolic pathways modulates inflammatory and fibrotic outcomes to PLA degradation. Interestingly, one of the small molecules used for targeting altered metabolic pathways is an acid, questioning the role of acidity in inflammatory responses to PLA and highlighting the pivotal role of immune cell metabolism in tissue engineering.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
I am an expert in biomaterials for drug delivery who has centered my research around opportunistic pathogens and commensal microbes. My graduate training focused on the development of an antibiotic delivery system for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement that improved upon several limitations of PMMA antibiotic bone cement. Specifically, it allowed for delivery of antibiotics previously not compatible with bone cement, was capable of more effectively treating long-term broad-spectrum infections, and could be refilled with additional drugs after implantation. As a postdoctoral researcher, I study how controlled manipulations to the composition of the gut microbiome influence bone tissue strength through clinical and pre-clinical studies. Through my work, I have found that the composition of the gut microbiome significantly differed in clinical orthopaedic surgery patients based on their pre-surgical bone mineral density. Additionally, my work has shown that gut microbiome-induced changes in bone matrix are not limited to the bone tissue that is formed while the microbiota is altered, suggesting that it may be possible to improve bone matrix later in life through microbiome-based interventions. As an independent investigator, my goal is to use my expertise in drug delivery platforms to develop systems that deliver molecules that mimic the function of beneficial gut microbes. The microbiome is a complex consortium of microbes that has been shown to be implicated in several disorders. Therefore, materials that mimic the function of therapeutic microbes have the potential to impact several distal organs. My long-term vision is to pioneer the next-generation of microbiome-based therapeutics that mimic the function of beneficial microbes, overcoming the challenges of delivering live microbes.</details>

Engineering meets biology: Three dimensional bioprinting of tissues and organs

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
A lot of money is spent developing new pharmaceutical drugs, but approval rates are
declining and fatal diseases like influenza, COVID19 are left untreated. This is because
animal testing methods don’t accurately predict human response to drugs. What if we
can 3D print living human tissue to test new drugs and study disease? 3D printing of
lung tissue allows us to develop better, safer, and cheaper drugs while reducing our
reliance on animal testing. Beyond drug development, this could usher in a future where
replacement organs are 3D printed using patient’s own cells, avoiding organ waitlists
and risk of rejection.

Engineering Organoid Microsystems to Model Human Physiology and Disease

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Recent advancements in organoid technology and organs-on-chips, also known as microphysiological systems or tissue chips, have provided new approaches to study human development and model disease states. While organoids rely on the self-organizing properties of human pluripotent stem cells to recapitulate the complex three- dimensional cellular microarchitecture of complete organs, organs-on-chips aim to reverse engineer the minimal functional unit of human organs by combining microfluidics and human cell lines. The integration of organoids and organs-on-chips offers the opportunity to overcome the limitations of each technology and enable the development of advanced in vitro microsystems to model diseases and test novel therapies. However, this requires a multidisciplinary design methodology to combine the specific biological needs of three-dimensional organoids with the design constraints of microfluidic organ-on-chip platforms. My research focuses on designing and implementing organoid microsystems engineered to recapitulate human physiology and disease. Here, I discuss the application of computational fluid dynamics to develop a microfluidic culture platform for organoids and the use of single cell RNA sequencing to characterize CRISPR-engineered organoids.

Mechanical forces regulate collagen turnover in health and disease

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Aberrant structure and altered composition of extracellular matrix (ECM), a hallmark of fibrosis and other pathologies including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, aging, etc., produce altered physical properties that lead to impaired function of almost all tissues. Fibrosis, a cause of almost half of all deaths in the developed world, is a condition where post-injury wound healing response causes abnormal deposition of the most abundant protein collagen and other ECM proteins in most adult tissues. Currently, there are no approved therapies to fully resolve fibrosis. In general, fibrillar collagen levels scale with stiffness of tissues, i.e., soft tissues like developing heart, adult brain contain less collagen than stiff tissues such as tendon, skeletal muscle, etc. Mechanical load magnitudes sustained by stiff tissues are larger than softer ones. Collagen, primarily synthesized by tissue resident fibroblasts, undergoes post-translation modifications as intermolecular collagen crosslinks whereas matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) mediate degradation of collagen. Thus, a well-regulated collagen turnover, reflected as a balance between synthesis and degradation of collagen, is necessary for maintaining proper structure and composition of ECM as well as enabling it to sustain mechanical loads resulting from cellular contractility and/or exogenous loads. In contrast, dysregulated collagen turnover during pathologies such as fibrosis results from perturbed interplay between ECM and cells that leads to tissues with increased stiffness and impaired function. Here, we uniquely combine label-free imaging, label-free methods to characterize biochemical composition and novel mechano- bioreactor designs to study fibrillar collagen in embryonic chick and adult mice tissues. Our data demonstrates that enzymatic degradation of tissue collagen by collagenases is mechanical strain dependent and is influenced by the presence of collagen crosslinks. The strain-dependence of collagen degradation by collagenases is independent of factors such as cellular protein synthesis and activity/specificity of collagenases including MMPs on collagen. Thus, collagen turnover focused understanding of tissue mechano-homeostasis, warrants the use of ECM mechanical stimulation as a therapeutic strategy to tailor ECM-cell interplay for restoring function of fibrotic tissues and improving tissue regeneration, which may include applications such as biomedical devices, tissue engineering, biomechanics, etc.
