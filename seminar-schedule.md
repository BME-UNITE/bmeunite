Biomimetic Hydrogels for the Sustained Delivery of GLP-1 Analogues to Improve Treatment of Diabetes

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The most challenging aspect of optimal glycemic control for the 118 million people in the US living with diabetes is impaired regulation of hepatic glucose production, which eventually leads to β-cell failure. Current insulin treatments are highly burdensome, resulting in poor patient compliance, and can cause dangerous hypoglycemic events. In contrast, treatment strategies based on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone secreted from the intestinal L-cells after ingestion of carbohydrates, reduce the risk of hypoglycemia by stimulating insulin and decreasing glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. As GLP-1 is rapidly degraded in the body, various GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been developed and approved for clinical use. Similar to endogenous GLP-1, GLP-1 RAs lower endogenous glucose production without the risk of hypoglycemic events and, importantly, expand insulin-secreting β-cell mass and restore the native ability of patients to regulate glycemia. Unfortunately, current GLP-1 RAs must be injected either daily or weekly, which results in significant patient burden and reduced patient compliance. Missing even one injection has important longitudinal effects as it takes several injections to return to therapeutic serum concentrations. New formulation approaches are needed to prolong therapeutic GLP-1 RA delivery to maintain therapeutic concentrations over the course of months per administration. We have developed an injectable hydrogel depot technology leveraging supramolecular interactions between polymeric nanoparticles and hydrophobically-modified hydroxypropyl methylcellulose polymers, that enable prolonged delivery of GLP-1 RAs. This hydrogel depot system sustains release of therapeutic protein cargo, enabling consistent diabetes management over the course of months with a single administration.</details>

Immune cell metabolism: A pivot in tissue engineering

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The metabolic underpinnings of immune cells in the implant microenvironment are poorly characterized, despite the critical role which foreign body response (FBR) plays in the function of implants. For instance, polylactide (PLA) is an old and the most widely used biopolymer in medicine. For decades, PLA had been thought to activate immune cells by reducing surrounding pH because PLA biodegrades into monomers and oligomers of lactic acid. This correlational observation had guided therapeutic strategies aimed at neutralizing pH in the PLA microenvironment. While undoubtedly offering some benefit, clinical reports of adverse immune responses to PLA persist to-date, significantly limiting the clinical utility of PLA. During my talk, I will present novel findings challenging this paradigm. Recent data shows that neutralized or acidic PLA degradation products activate immune cells. Uniquely, these activated immune cells exhibit previously unreported changes in metabolism. Specifically targeting altered metabolic pathways modulates inflammatory and fibrotic outcomes to PLA degradation. Interestingly, one of the small molecules used for targeting altered metabolic pathways is an acid, questioning the role of acidity in inflammatory responses to PLA and highlighting the pivotal role of immune cell metabolism in tissue engineering.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
I am an expert in biomaterials for drug delivery who has centered my research around opportunistic pathogens and commensal microbes. My graduate training focused on the development of an antibiotic delivery system for poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement that improved upon several limitations of PMMA antibiotic bone cement. Specifically, it allowed for delivery of antibiotics previously not compatible with bone cement, was capable of more effectively treating long-term broad-spectrum infections, and could be refilled with additional drugs after implantation. As a postdoctoral researcher, I study how controlled manipulations to the composition of the gut microbiome influence bone tissue strength through clinical and pre-clinical studies. Through my work, I have found that the composition of the gut microbiome significantly differed in clinical orthopaedic surgery patients based on their pre-surgical bone mineral density. Additionally, my work has shown that gut microbiome-induced changes in bone matrix are not limited to the bone tissue that is formed while the microbiota is altered, suggesting that it may be possible to improve bone matrix later in life through microbiome-based interventions. As an independent investigator, my goal is to use my expertise in drug delivery platforms to develop systems that deliver molecules that mimic the function of beneficial gut microbes. The microbiome is a complex consortium of microbes that has been shown to be implicated in several disorders. Therefore, materials that mimic the function of therapeutic microbes have the potential to impact several distal organs. My long-term vision is to pioneer the next-generation of microbiome-based therapeutics that mimic the function of beneficial microbes, overcoming the challenges of delivering live microbes.</details>
