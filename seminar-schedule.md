Engineering Biomimetic Materials for Female Reproductive Health

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Female reproductive health and womenâ€™s health research are historically understudied fields that would significantly benefit from engineering expertise due to the unique biomechanical environment in the female reproductive tract and the dynamic tissue changes orchestrated throughout the menstrual cycle by sex hormones. With the synergistic techniques of tissue engineering, biomaterials science, biomechanics, and reproductive biology, we engineer models of the female reproductive system, including the endometrium, decidua, and vagina, to study pregnancy-related disorders and birth injuries. We use these tissue engineering models to understand cell-cell interactions, cell- matrix interactions, and hormone dynamics in the context of early pregnancy and vaginal tearing during childbirth.

To mimic, instruct, and define the cellular microenvironment in the female reproductive tract, we use gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. Derived from gelatin, GelMA hydrogels are biomimetic, biocompatible, and bioactive. Functionalization of gelatin into GelMA renders GelMA stability under physiological temperatures as well as enhanced tunability of mechanical properties. We fabricated a library of GelMA hydrogels and composites that capture a range of biomechanical properties specifically designed to mimic tissue biomechanical properties. We then construct GelMA hydrogel composites by combining GelMA hydrogels with other materials, including electrospun fibers and hyaluronic acid methacrylate. We perform sophisticated material characterization with spherical nanoindentation and define the effects of biomechanical properties on cellular behavior and the effect of cells on hydrogel mechanical properties.

We demonstrated that GelMA hydrogel platforms are adaptable for studying dynamic endometrial processes, including endometrial angiogenesis, hormone responsiveness (e.g., decidualization of endometrial stromal cells), epithelial monolayer formation in a stratified tissue model, and trophoblast invasion. We also established a three-dimensional model of the vaginal epithelium by incorporating primary human vaginal epithelial cells in gelatin-elastin fiber composites impregnated with GelMA hydrogels. Our ongoing studies seek to advance these existing model systems into complex, three-dimensional tissue mimics of the endometrium and vagina for not only basic science purposes but also for regenerative medicine applications.

Finally, we inform our engineering studies by performing systematic reviews and meta- analyses of the medical literature to identify health issues in female reproductive health, to assess the quality of existing literature, and to highlight future directions of the field that can be informed with basic science research using engineering models.</details>

Engineering hydrogels for cardiac applications

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Injectable hydrogel for treating ventricular arrhythmias (VA): The only effective treatment for VA is cardiac defibrillation, where a high-energy shock extinguishes the reentrant circuits that initiate and sustain VA. However, these high-energy shocks exceed the pain threshold. The primary goal of this research is to develop new painless strategies to extinguish reentrant VA. The current treatment requires large energy because the current leads capture the tissue from a single point far from the heterogeneous scarred tissue responsible for the electrical disruptions. We hypothesized that flexible electrodes that can access midmyocardium near the scarred area via the cardiac veins, we could terminate arrhythmias with low-energy shocks. However, there were no pacing electrodes small enough to navigate these tributaries to test this hypothesis. To the best of our knowledge, we were the first to report an injectable electrode used to successfully pace the midmyocardium and mimic physiologic conduction. As such, this injectable hydrogel electrode developed during my Ph.D. work provides a novel way to improve current defibrillation strategies and opens opportunities for new therapeutic approaches. By capturing a larger area and deeper into the midmyocardium, this technology enhances new ways to study tissue activation that were not possible with current pacing leads.

From microspheres to rods: Prior work with injectable, acellular bulk hydrogels for cardiac repair resulted in improved angiogenesis and cardiac function, even without potent angiogenic cues; however, the lack of macroporosity of bulk hydrogel structures limits rapid cellular infiltration. This limitation is mitigated by granular
hydrogels, which exhibit an inherent porosity to support cell infiltration and activity. Widely studied granular hydrogels consist of spherical particles. In contrast, our lab recently developed granular hydrogels from rod-like microgels of aspect ratio 2.2 for improved cellular invasions in both in vitro and in vivo studies. However, it is unclear how increased aspect ratios affect granular hydrogel packing, injectability, cell invasion, and tissue reconstruction, which are crucial for delivery, mechanics, and angiogenesis. To address this, we fabricated rod-like microgels with increased aspect ratios and compared these to control spherical microgels that matched the volumes of rods. To monitor cellular invasion in vitro, spheroids of endothelial/mesenchymal cells were introduced to the granular materials and cultured for 3 days to assess cells sprouting in the granular material. I uncovered that the sprout displacements were larger when the spheroids were placed in the granular hydrogels from microgels with higher aspect ratio rods when compared to spheres of similar volume. This suggests that rods of higher aspect ratios have higher porosity and less tortuous path to enable cell sprouting, providing a key design consideration for engineering granular materials in biomedical applications. Ongoing work includes the assessment of granular hydrogels in a rat heart infarct model.</details>
