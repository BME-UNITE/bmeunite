An anisotropic viscoelastic model of the macaque rhesus cervix to quantify cervical remodeling

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Through pregnancy, the cervix, a collagenous and hydrated tissue, undergoes a remarkable transformation from a rigid/closed structure that keeps the fetus inside the uterus to a more compliant/extensible one that opens to facilitate delivery at parturition. This process, known as cervical remodeling, involves complex changes in the cervix's equilibrium and dynamic mechanical properties, such as stiffness, viscoelasticity, and permeability. Constitutive models of the cervix extracellular matrix (ECM) calibrated with experimental data at equilibrium and obtained from animal cervical tissue, primarily rodents, have proven helpful in studying how the cervix softens through gestation. Recently, a poro-viscoelastic model of the human cervix was used to describe the human cervix's time-dependent behavior but limited to compressive strains and two gestational points (pregnant and nonpregnant). The variations in the cervix's intrinsic viscoelastic properties under tension at different pregnancy stages have not yet been thoroughly studied, which is crucial for understanding better cervical remodeling. Building upon these previous constitutive models, we implemented an anisotropic viscoelastic model of the cervix ECM, which captures the viscoelastic behavior of the cervix under tensile deformation. To calibrate our model, we used force-displacement experimental data from spherical indentation and uniaxial tension tests in cervix samples from Rhesus Macaques, chosen because of their homology to humans, and collected at four relevant gestational time points. We observed that Rhesus Macaque cervical tissue is non-linear elastic, and the stiffness of the toe and linear region decreases with gestational age. Furthermore, the time relaxation properties of cervical tissue differ significantly between nonpregnant/early pregnant and late pregnant stages. This work gives insights into normal cervical remodeling, which is crucial to developing diagnostic methods and treatments for preterm birth (birth before 37 weeks).</details>

Application of Low Intensity Focused Ultrasound for Peripheral Nerve Pain

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
Pain, as defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), is an unpleasant bodily signal associated with immediate or potential tissue damage, universally experienced but uniquely perceived by everyone. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a study revealing that approximately 21% of adults in the United States experience chronic pain, defined as pain occurring every day or most days for at least three months. Direct consequences of severe pain include loss of strength, reliance on medication, and disrupted sleep. Pain can induce significant changes in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Some of these changes are adaptive and short-lived, while others may become maladaptive and lead to the development of chronic pain.
Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (LIFU) is a novel, non-invasive method with the advantage of precise stimulation in deep tissues. This seminar presents the context of LIFU use and some preliminary results related to its potential for treating peripheral nerve pain through neurostimulation.</details>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
The spinal column is an invaluable structure of the musculoskeletal system and the defining characteristic of vertebrate animals. An essential component of the spinal column is the intervertebral disc (IVD), a connective tissue that provides the shock absorption and weight distribution biomechanical properties of the spine. IVDs are complex, heterogeneous structures that are prone to cumulative damage due to a limited regenerative capacity. The accrual of IVD injuries leads to tissue degeneration, which is a leading contributor to debilitating back pain and a reduction in quality of life. Successful healing of connective tissue injuries relies on temporally regulated immune cells that rapidly infiltrate damaged tissues and initiate regenerative signaling cascades. These immune cells rapidly migrate into injured tissues and function as critical mediators of tissue regeneration and healing. However, the identity of these immune cell subtypes, their temporal coordination, and their effect on the IVD repair after injury remain understudied. The objective of this study is to prevent IVD degeneration by defining the role of infiltrating immune cells during injury to improve tissue repair.
The importance of immune cells in facilitating healing has been well characterized in musculoskeletal (MSK) tissues such as bone and muscle. Cd3+ T lymphocytes have been shown to be critical mediators of repair, but their role in IVD healing is unknown. To determine the role of immune cells during IVD damage, we utilized a needle puncture model to induce the robust infiltration of Cd45+ immune cells by causing a severe injury to IVD tissue. Our findings show a sex divergent response of anti-inflammatory Cd3+ γδ T cells during the acute IVD injury response and a dysregulation in IVD tissue mechanics in mice lacking lymphocytes. We hypothesize that Cd3+ γδ T cells are essential for IVD tissue repair. By utilizing methodologies such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction, bulk RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and drug therapy, this study offers a targeted approach to modulate IVD repair by elucidating the types and temporal regulation of key immune cell subtypes important during IVD repair.</details>
